## If/Else

Do `var now = new Date()`. Use `console.log('your text here')` to print to the console.

Create an if/elif/else statement that prints:

- "Single digits." if `now.getSeconds()` is less than 10

- "The minute is young." if `now.getSeconds()` is less than 30

- "The minute is almost over." otherwise

### Extra Credit:
- Given that `now.getSeconds()` is young, check whether it is an even number. If so, print: `"It's of even length too!"`


## Looping
Implement "99 Bottles of Beer". Your solution should print:

There are 99 bottles of beer on the wall...
There are 98 bottles of beer on the wall...
...
There are 0 bottles of beer on the wall...

### Extra Credit:
- Instead of `1 bottles of beer`, make it print `1 bottle of beer`.
