## Numbers

Compute the following using Javascript in the Chrome developer console.

Tip: Use Cmd + Option + J to open up the Chrome developer console on a Mac.

2 * 7 * 3.5

3 + 5 - (2 * 6)

(3 + 5 - 2) * 6

find the absolute value of -13

18489 modulo 23 (Google modulo syntax if you don't know it)

15 to the power of 5 (Google exponent syntax if you don't know it)


## Strings
Create the below strings in Javascript

1. Hi, my name is {{ your name }}!

2. I don't like junk food

3. I don't like silly words like "diphtong"

4. A new line character is written like \n


### String Concatentation

1. Set a variable called `name` equal to your full name.

2. Set a variable called `firstName` equal to your first name.

3. Set a variable called `lastName` equal to your last name.

4. Then combine `firstName` and `lastName` so that it equals your full name, and save this in a variable called `fullName`.

5. Prove using the === operator that `fullName` and `name` are equal.

6. Get the length of your name. (Google for how to do this)


## Booleans

1. Evaluate a true expression

2. Evaluate a false expression

3. false || true && true

4. true || false && true || false && false

5. false || true && true || false || alert('I got here!')

6. false || true && false || false || alert('I got here!')


## Equality Testing

4 == 5

5 == 5

5 == '5'

5 === '5'

4 < 5

5 >= 4

9 !== '9'

9 != '9'

8 != 9
